# Design decisions — mutate4csharp

Locked decisions for the C# port of `mutate4java`. Source of truth alongside `docs/features/`. The
authoritative behavioral contract is the read-only `../mutate4java` (`spec.md` + source + tests).

## Product intent

- A **mutation-testing tool for C# projects** — the C# member of the `mutate4*` family (`mutate4clj`
  → `mutate4java` → `mutate4csharp`). It targets one `.cs` file, discovers AST mutation sites, runs
  the owning project's unit tests per mutant, and reports killed / survived / uncovered mutants with
  an embedded differential manifest. Ecosystem: Roslyn (parse + mutation), Coverlet → Cobertura
  (coverage), `dotnet test` / MSBuild (driver).
- **Faithful 1:1 port** of `mutate4java`: class decomposition, the mutation set, CLI contract, report
  format, and exit codes are preserved. Only the ecosystem adapters and the approved deliberate
  departures (below) change.
- **Test fidelity:** every `mutate4java` test gets a faithful C# counterpart asserting the same
  behavior — except where an approved departure changes it.
- **OSS libraries (resolved):** the only new runtime dependency is **Roslyn**
  (`Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp`). Coverage via **coverlet.collector** (`XPlat Code Coverage`);
  tests **xUnit**; assertions **FluentAssertions** pinned `[7.0.0,8.0.0)` (v8 is commercial); no JSON
  dependency; process / hashing / XML via the BCL.
- **Idiomatic (resolved):** the adopt-now baseline below. Stryker.NET is **rejected** as the engine —
  a different product that cannot reproduce the manifest / differential / scan / exact strings / exit
  codes.

## Locked choices

| Area | Decision | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Engine | **O1** — port the bespoke engine onto Roslyn | Stryker.NET rejected |
| Analysis target | one C# `.cs` file | Roslyn syntax tree + `SemanticModel` |
| Namespace | `Microsoft.Mutate4CSharp` | `AssemblyName`/`RootNamespace` = `Microsoft.<Project>`; sub-namespaces mirror the Java packages |
| TFM | `net8.0` | manual base64url helper (net9 `Base64Url` not used) |
| Layout | **single exe** `Mutate4CSharp` + `Mutate4CSharp.Tests` | tests reference the exe assembly |
| Parser | Roslyn (`Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp`) | single-file `CSharpCompilation` + `SemanticModel` for numeric/reference typing |
| Coverage | Coverlet → **Cobertura** via `--collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"` | newest `coverage.cobertura.xml` under results dir; `hits>0` = covered |
| Test framework | **xUnit** + `Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk` + `coverlet.collector` | already committed in `Mutate4CSharp.Tests.Common.targets` |
| Assertions | **FluentAssertions** `[7.0.0,8.0.0)` | lock file enforces the pin (v8 is commercial) |
| Module root | **`<Project>.Tests` / `<Project>.UnitTests`** convention | see below; fail-fast exit `2` if absent |
| Helper visibility | **`public`** by default (`file` where trivially single-file) | guardrail #9: never `internal` |
| Manifest marker | `/* mutate4csharp-manifest … */`, `version=1` | wider `kind` vocabulary (DD1) |

## Deliberate departures from mutate4java (approved by Mr. Das)

Default stance is **zero** behavioral departures; the CRAP-era departures do **not** apply (this is a
mutation tool, not a complexity/CRAP analyzer). The following six are approved:

1. **DD1 — C#-specific manifest scope kinds.** Java's 3 kinds (`class/method/field`) widen to a C#
   taxonomy (type flavors + `constructor/finalizer/operator/conversion-operator/local-function/
   property/accessor/indexer/event/enum-member`), with per-accessor granularity. Manifest **format
   and `version=1` are unchanged** — only the `kind` value set widens. No report-string or exit-code
   change.
2. **DD2 — Fail-fast `exit 2`** when (a) no `<Project>.Tests`/`<Project>.UnitTests` (or owning
   `.csproj`) resolves, or (b) the baseline executes **zero** unit tests. This is **in addition to** —
   not a replacement for — mutate4java's faithful "green baseline + all sites uncovered → exit 0",
   which is **kept**. ("All uncovered but tests ran" → 0; "no test project / zero tests" → 2.)
3. **DD3 — Unit-only, single-project test scoping.** Run only `<Project>.Tests|.UnitTests` with the
   filter `type!=IntegrationTests&Category!=no-mutate`, replacing mutate4java's whole-owning-module
   `mvn test -DexcludeTags=no-mutate`. `--test-command` still fully overrides (coverage → allCovered
   per spec §9).
4. **DD4 — expression-bodied members are return sites for null-replacement.** C# `=> expr`
   value-returning member bodies are treated as `return expr;` sites (Java `visitReturn` has no arrow
   oracle — Java has no expression-bodied form). **Fires for:** method, property-get, indexer-get,
   `get`-accessor, operator, conversion-operator, and non-void local-function arrow bodies.
   **Excluded:** `set`/`init`/`add`/`remove` accessors, constructors, finalizers (structural gate on
   the arrow-clause parent) and any `void` body (factory `IsReference` type gate). Lambdas are
   naturally excluded (their body is not an `ArrowExpressionClause`). Guarded so each value-returning
   body is null-replaced **exactly once** (expression-bodied and block-bodied forms are mutually
   exclusive — the former has no `ReturnStatement`, the latter no `ArrowExpressionClause`). Surfaced by
   the S7 independent eval; no Java oracle → documented departure. No report-string or exit-code change.
5. **DD5 — honor the project's global/implicit usings in the single-file compiler.** `RoslynSourceCompiler`
   references the whole BCL (via `TRUSTED_PLATFORM_ASSEMBLIES`) — matching mutate4java's "platform
   present, application classpath emptied" split — but a strictly single-file compilation drops C#'s
   **project-scoped** implicit/global usings (`ImplicitUsings=enable` is the SDK default), so
   implicit-using-dependent BCL types (`List<T>`/`ISet<T>`/`Task<T>`) fail to bind → `TypeKind.Error`
   → skipped for null-replacement. Java doesn't hit this because its imports are **in-file** (they
   survive single-file compilation), so mutate4java *does* mutate stdlib reference returns. To restore
   parity, `Compile` discovers the target file's owning `.csproj` and injects the reconstructed using
   context as a **context-only** syntax tree (only the target file's body is analyzed for sites):
   precedence **generated `obj/**/<Project>.GlobalUsings.g.cs` → synthesized base `Microsoft.NET.Sdk`
   set → plus a parse-only scan of the project's `.cs` for explicit `global using`s**. This is the
   **usings lever only** — the references lever is untouched, so it is **bounded** (a `using` can bind
   only an already-referenced BCL type, never a third-party one) and **monotonic** (it can only add
   null-mutants; existing kills never regress; a malformed/unreadable owning project degrades to the
   pre-DD5 no-context path via a narrow catch; the per-owning-project using context is memoized to
   avoid an O(N²) rescan). The **synthesized fallback** reads the `.csproj` XML directly (it does NOT
   follow `<Import>` / run MSBuild), so `ImplicitUsings` declared in an imported `.targets` is covered
   only by the **preferred generated-file path** — which always exists after the baseline build a real
   run performs (confirmed production-faithful by the S8 re-dogfood). **Caveat:** monotonicity holds *within the tool's contract* (code that
   actually compiles) — an injected `global using` could in theory create a simple-name ambiguity that
   drops a site, but only on code that wouldn't compile under the project's real global usings anyway.
   Surfaced by the S8 dogfood; **enriching references (project/NuGet) is explicitly rejected** as *less*
   faithful than Java's empty application classpath. No report-string or exit-code change.
6. **DD6 — Test-project auto-discovery (amends DD2(a)/DD3's naming requirement).** The
   `<Project>.Tests`/`.UnitTests` name is no longer required. After tier 1 (the convention, unchanged
   with its proximity tie-break), a **marked** test project that transitively references the owner is
   accepted: tier 2 = named `<Project>.*` (e.g. `Foo.BlackBoxTests`, `Foo.Specs`), tier 3 = any.
   **Marked** = an **unconditioned** `<IsTestProject>true</IsTestProject>` or `<PackageReference
   Include="Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk">` in the `.csproj`, a `Directory.Build.props`/`.targets` up to the
   workspace root, or any file those `<Import>` (recursive, cycle-safe, bounded to the workspace).
   Import paths expand only `$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)` (of the importing file) and
   `$(MSBuildProjectDirectory)`; any other `$(...)` skips that import, a conditioned marker is ignored,
   and a malformed file contributes nothing (all fail-safe → at worst exit 2, never a wrong pick). **>1
   candidate at tier 2 or 3 → exit 2** with a `Multiple test projects` stderr line — deliberately the
   same rule as crap4csharp's departure #16, so the two tools always resolve the **same** test project
   for a file, or both refuse. `--test-command` does not bypass resolution. DD3's filter
   (`type!=IntegrationTests&Category!=no-mutate`) is unchanged: untagged in-process blackbox tests run;
   Gherkin/E2E suites tagged `IntegrationTests` stay excluded. No stdout report-string change; one new
   stderr line. (Ruled by Mr. Das: tiers as crap4csharp; ambiguity → fail-fast, option A.)

Exit code `2` is therefore **broadened** to "baseline failed **OR** no unit-test project **OR**
ambiguous test project **OR** zero unit tests executed" — four sub-reasons documented under one code,
keeping the `0/1/2/3` contract.
All stdout report strings are unchanged; DD2 adds **stderr** lines only.

**Fidelity principle — stdout verbatim, stderr adapted.** Only **stdout report strings** carry the
byte-for-byte verbatim guarantee (asserted by the formatter/report tests). **stderr diagnostics** are
**adapted to the C# ecosystem** where the Java text names a Java-only artifact: e.g. the coverage-reuse
messages (`"Reusing existing coverage data."` / `"Coverage reuse requested, but no existing coverage
report was found. Continuing without coverage filtering."`) **drop mutate4java's JaCoCo path**
(`target/site/jacoco/jacoco.xml`) — the coverlet equivalent lives at a non-deterministic
`TestResults/<guid>/coverage.cobertura.xml` not knowable at message time. Substance (reuse vs.
not-found→continuing) is preserved. Same principle already governs the DD2 stderr lines and the usage
text.

## Supported mutation set (faithful — spec §6.1)

One mutation site per (AST-based; comments, string/char literals, generic `<>`, and manifest content
are excluded):

- boolean literals `true` ↔ `false`
- equality / comparison `== != < <= > >=`
- arithmetic `+` ↔ `-`, `*` ↔ `/` (`+` is numeric-only — no string-concat mutation)
- conditional boolean `&&` ↔ `||`
- unary removal `!expr → expr`, `-expr → expr`
- integer constants `0` ↔ `1`
- reference-valued rvalues → `null` (return / initializer / **simple** assignment RHS — NOT compound
  `+=`/`??=` RHS, matching Java `visitAssignment`=`AssignmentTree`(simple-`=`)-only with unconditional
  recursion; **and expression-bodied value-returning member bodies per DD4**; not call arguments)

Numeric-vs-reference decisions use the resolved `SemanticModel` (single-file `CSharpCompilation` with
default framework references); C# value types (structs/enums) are non-reference — the faithful analog
of Java primitives.

## Manifest scope-kind taxonomy (DD1)

Scope id = `"<kind>:<prefix>#<detail>:<startLine>"`. `prefix` = the enclosing **type**-name stack
(outer→inner, including the type itself) joined by `.` — members do **not** push onto the prefix
(faithful to Java, which stacks only class names). `semanticHash` = SHA-256 hex of the declaration
node's source text; `startLine`/`endLine` from Roslyn line mapping. `addScope` de-dups by id.

- **Type kinds (push prefix):** `class struct record record-struct interface enum delegate`.
- **Member kinds (scopes, no prefix push):** `method constructor finalizer operator
  conversion-operator local-function property accessor indexer field event enum-member`.
- **Details:** method `Name(paramCount)`; ctor `ctor(n)` / static `cctor(0)`; finalizer
  `finalizer(0)`; operator `operator<Op>(n)`; conversion `implicit <T>(1)` / `explicit <T>(1)`;
  accessor `<Owner>.get|set|init|add|remove` (only when the accessor has a body); indexer `this[](n)`;
  field one scope per declarator (`int a, b;` → two); enum member `Name`.
- **Not scopes:** namespaces (and never a prefix component), lambdas / anonymous methods, local
  variables / parameters, using / attribute / statement nodes, compiler-generated members.
- **Fallback:** `file:<filename>` (top-level statements / outside any declaration).

## Module-root + test-selection convention

- **`<Project>` derivation:** ascend from the target `.cs` file to the nearest `.csproj`; `<Project>`
  = its file name without extension (= `MSBuildProjectName`). No owning `.csproj` up to the workspace
  root → **exit 2**.
- **Test-project discovery (tiered; see DD6):** among `.csproj` files whose `<ProjectReference>`
  closure includes `<Project>.csproj` (validates the mapping in mono-repos), pick by tier — **(1)**
  `<Project>.Tests.csproj` / `<Project>.UnitTests.csproj`, tie-break: sibling → under a `tests/` dir →
  nearest by path; `.Tests` over `.UnitTests` (unchanged); **(2)** *marked* test projects named
  `<Project>.*`; **(3)** any *marked* test project. >1 at tier 2 or 3 → **exit 2** (`Multiple test
  projects`, never a guess). None found → **exit 2**.
- **Default test command:** `dotnet test <Project>.Tests.csproj --collect:"XPlat Code Coverage"
  --filter "type!=IntegrationTests&Category!=no-mutate" --results-directory <dir> --logger trx`.
  Unit = `type` ∈ {`UnitTests`, `Unit`} or no `type` trait; `IntegrationTests` excluded (VSTest treats
  an absent property as `!=` any value); `Category!=no-mutate` is the faithful port of
  `-DexcludeTags=no-mutate`. `--test-command` overrides entirely (then coverage = allCovered).
- **Baseline + coverage** come from one `dotnet test --collect` call; the runner reads the newest
  `coverage.cobertura.xml` under the results dir. `--reuse-coverage` reuses it; missing → continue
  without filtering (spec §9). The coverage run passes **`-p:DeterministicSourcePaths=false`** so
  coverlet's Cobertura `<source>` stays a real on-disk path (the A4 key reconciles; defeats the
  deterministic-build `/_/…` remap); the executed-test count for the DD2b zero-tests gate comes from
  the baseline `.trx` (`CoverageRun.ExecutedTestCount`, a DD2b model extension).
- **Baseline test-project scoping (all three baseline paths, DD3-consistent):** the **fresh** path
  scopes via `CoverageRunner` (explicit `<Project>.Tests.csproj`, cwd = its dir); the **reuse** path
  applies `WithTestProject(<absolute TestProjectFile>)` with cwd = test-project dir (S7 finding-4 fix —
  absolute is correct here since cwd is the *real* project dir, deliberately unlike the worker path's
  repo-root-relative form); the **`--test-command`** path runs the user command at the **workspace
  root** (S7 finding-1 fix — aligned with the workers, which run at their repo-root copy). All three
  therefore bind to exactly the resolved test project, never fanning out to a stray `.sln`.
- **Coverage key (A4):** resolve each Cobertura `<class filename>` against the report `<sources>` to
  an absolute path and compare case-insensitively to the target site's absolute path; covered iff the
  `<line … hits=H>` has `H>0`. (Replaces JaCoCo package-path keying / `SourcePathNormalizer`.)
- **Worker isolation:** copy the **repo root** (workspace root) excluding `bin/ obj/ .git/ .vs/
  TestResults/` and the worker base; the worker base lives under
  `%TEMP%/mutate4csharp/run-<guid>/worker-N`; the mutated file lives at the copy-root-relative path;
  `dotnet test` runs with cwd = worker root, targeting the copy-relative test project. (A
  ProjectReference-closure copy is a deferred optimization — see the feature file.)

## Idiomatic policy

- **Adopt-now baseline:** nullable enable; `record` value types for `model/`; `InvariantCulture` for
  all rendered numbers; explicit `"\n"` in report / scan / manifest output; async stdout/stderr drain
  + `Process.Kill(entireProcessTree: true)`; `IReadOnlyList<T>` returns; `Environment.ProcessorCount`
  for default max-workers (`max(1, N/2)`); ordinal string comparisons; single-file `CSharpCompilation`
  for the semantic model; file-scoped namespaces + `_camelCase` privates + `I`-prefixed interfaces.
- **Static vs instance (CA1822):** `CA1822` is globally disabled in `.editorconfig` (alongside
  `CA1515`/`CA2007`) — a purity/perf rule that fights deliberate app-level DI composition and never
  flags a bug. **Mirror `mutate4java` per member:** port Java `static` members as `static` (e.g.
  `ManifestValueCodec.encode/decode`), and keep Java instance-composed helpers as **instances**
  (preserving the ctor/field-injection composition graph). Never staticize a stateless helper merely
  to satisfy the analyzer.
- **Ordinal sorting (fidelity landmine):** any Java `String.compareTo` / natural-order sort maps to
  `StringComparer.Ordinal` (UTF-16 ordinal) — never a culture/invariant comparer. A culture comparer
  would silently reorder and change hash-affecting order (manifest module hash, and later
  selection/report ordering). Applies to all string ordering across the port.
- **Exception-mapping fidelity (worker-cleanup retry):** `WorkerWorkspaces` deletion retries on
  transient locks. Java's `AccessDeniedException extends IOException`, so its `IOException` retry arm
  already covers permission denials; .NET's `UnauthorizedAccessException` is **not** an `IOException`,
  so `TryDelete` explicitly catches it and returns `new IOException(msg, ex)` → `DeleteWithRetries`
  treats it as retryable (5×/50ms), matching Java's behavior. General rule: when porting Java
  `catch (IOException)` cleanup, map the .NET exceptions that Java's `IOException` hierarchy subsumes
  (notably `UnauthorizedAccessException`) into the same retry path rather than letting them escape.
- **Record mapping (by semantics, not keyword):** a Java `record`/`final class` used as a **value
  carrier** → C# `record`; one used as a **reference-identity resource/handle** (e.g. `CoverageReport`,
  `WorkerWorkspaces`) → C# `sealed class` (a record over `IReadOnlyList`/handle fields would emit a
  misleading reference-based `Equals` nobody should call).
- **Greenlit engineering (behavior-neutral):** P1 single Roslyn walk (sites + scopes together); P2
  `record struct` for the tiny hot keys (`CoverageSite`, `ScopeRef`); P3 `Channel<MutationJob>` worker
  pool with identical scheduling semantics.
- **Declined:** `System.CommandLine` (the exact error strings + conflict rules are asserted verbatim
  by `CliArgumentsParserTest`); Stryker.NET as the engine.

## Timeouts, workers, exit codes (faithful)

- Mutant timeout = `max(1000ms, max(1, baselineDuration) * timeoutFactor)`; default factor `10`; a
  timeout → **KILLED (timeout)**, sentinel exit `124`.
- Default max-workers = `max(1, ProcessorCount/2)`; `--max-workers` caps it.
- Exit codes: `0` success / all killed / all-uncovered / scan / manifest-update; `1` usage error; `2`
  baseline failed **or** no unit-test project **or** zero unit tests executed; `3` ≥1 survivor.

## Environment / CI

- CI is GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): restore → build (Release, warnings-as-errors) →
  test with coverage. `master` is **remote-protected** — every change lands via PR.
- Kept from the scaffold: `.editorconfig`; analyzers (NetAnalyzers / StyleCop / BannedApi);
  warnings-as-errors in Release; `global.json`; `nuget.config` (nuget.org only); the agentic-loop
  files; `meta-design` + feature template; the `build-test` skills.

## Test-parity ledger

The fidelity mandate is "every mutate4java test → a faithful C# counterpart." Deviations from a
1:1 port are recorded here so an auditor never reads a dropped test as missing coverage:

- **T15 CLI-application oracle = 25 cases = 21 faithful Java ports + 4 DD2-new.** The 4 new cases pin
  the DD2/DD2b departures (no-owning-project, no-test-project, zero-unit-tests, reuse/`--test-command`
  exemptions) — departures that have **no Java oracle** by construction.
- **4 Java tests dropped as Maven-obsolete (under DD3/A4).** `moduleRootFor` / `sourceSuffix`-style
  tests asserted mutate4java's whole-owning-module Maven resolution and JaCoCo package-path keying,
  both of which DD3 (single-project `<Project>.Tests|.UnitTests` scoping) and A4 (Cobertura
  `<sources>`-relative absolute-path keying) **replace**. The replacement behavior is covered by
  `ModuleResolverTests` + the Cobertura parser tests — so the behavior is not lost, only relocated.
- **S7 remediation adds (findings surfaced by the independent `gpt-5.6-sol` eval).** The blind eval
  (fed only the Requirements) confirmed most "non-conformance" flags were the approved DD1–DD4
  departures, and surfaced genuine gaps now closed: **A1** green all-killed→exit-0 + mixed-UNCOVERED
  report; **A2** baseline-red→exit-2; **A3** `--update-manifest`-on-red→exit-0 (tests not run);
  **A4** `ProcessTestCommandExecutorTests` (5 faithful ports — configured run, `WithCommand`/
  `WithTestProject` argv, timeout→124, output-on-failure); **A5** consolidated 4-family KILLED in one
  run (the operator set stays exhaustively pinned by `MutationCatalogTests`); **A6** `--lines` e2e
  (CliExecution-scope); **A7** guarded real-timeout IT.
- **Testability seam (A4).** `ProcessTestCommandExecutor.Command` (get-only `IReadOnlyList<string>?`,
  `null` on the raw-launcher path, **never read by `RunTests`**) exposes the constructed argv so the
  DD3 `WithTestProject` / A9 `WithCommand` argv is assertable without spawning. `public` is mandated by
  the no-`internal` guardrail; it carries the command as executor state, which is **more** faithful
  than the earlier omission (Java's `ProcessTestCommandExecutor` holds the override in a private
  write-but-never-read field). `ProcessTestCommandFactory.ShellCommand` is the single OS-detected
  shell-argv source of truth (`cmd.exe /c` / `/bin/sh -lc`) shared by `Command` and the spawn path —
  byte-identical A9 behavior.
